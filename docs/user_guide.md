## Workflow Engine

Cyclone provides a powerful workflow engine that serves general workflow purpose. You can orchestrate any workflows you need by taking advantage of it.

[Examples](../examples) shows some examples that can help you build your own workflows. To run the examples, run

```bash
$ make run_examples SCENE=cicd REGISTRIES=<registry>/<project>
```

In addition to YAML format manifest files, you can also create your workflows via APIs provided by Cyclone Server. Refer to [API Docs](./swagger-api-docs.md) for detailed APIs.
