# Contributing to the Docker Notary documentation

The documentation in this directory is part of the [https://docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com) website.  Docker uses [the Hugo static generator](http://gohugo.io/overview/introduction/) to convert project Markdown files to a static HTML site. 

You don't need to be a Hugo expert to contribute to the Notary documentation. If you are familiar with Markdown, you can modify the content in the `docs` files.  

If you want to add a new file or change the location of the document in the menu, you do need to know a little more.

## Documentation contributing workflow

1. Edit a Markdown file in the tree.

2. Save your changes.

3. Make sure you are in the `docs` subdirectory.

4. Build the documentation.

        $ make docs
         ---> ffcf3f6c4e97

## Tips on Hugo metadata and menu positioning

The top of each Docker Notary documentation file contains TOML metadata. The metadata is commented out to prevent it from appearing in GitHub.

    <!--[metadata]>
    +++
    title = "Extending services in Notary"
    description = "How to use Docker Notary's extends keyword to share configuration between files and projects"
    keywords = ["fig, composition, Notary, docker, orchestration, documentation, docs"]
    [menu.main]
    parent="smn_workw_Notary"
    weight=2
    +++
    <![end-metadata]-->  

The metadata alone has this structure:

    +++
    title = "Extending services in Notary"
    description = "How to use Docker Notary's extends keyword to share configuration between files and projects"
    keywords = ["fig, composition, Notary, docker, orchestration, documentation, docs"]
    [menu.main]
    parent="smn_workw_Notary"
    weight=2
    +++
    
The `[menu.main]` section refers to navigation defined [in the main Docker menu](https://github.com/docker/docs-base/blob/hugo/config.toml). This metadata says *add a menu item called* Extending services in Notary *to the menu with the* `smn_workdw_Notary` *identifier*.  If you locate the menu in the configuration, you'll find *Create multi-container applications* is the menu title.

You can move an article in the tree by specifying a new parent. You can shift the location of the item by changing its weight.  Higher numbers are heavier and shift the item to the bottom of menu. Low or no numbers shift it up.


## Other key documentation repositories

The `docker/docs-base` repository contains [the Hugo theme and menu configuration](https://github.com/docker/docs-base). If you open the `Dockerfile` you'll see the `make docs` relies on this as a base image for building the Notary documentation.
    
The `docker/docs.docker.com` repository contains [build system for building the Docker documentation site](https://github.com/docker/docs.docker.com). Fork this repository to build the entire documentation site.
