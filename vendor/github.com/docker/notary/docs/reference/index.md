# Notary configuration files

This document is for power users of the [notary client](../advanced_usage.md),
or for those who are [running their own service](../running_a_service.md) who
want to facilitate CLI interaction or specify custom options.

You can configure the following aspects of Notary:

* [Notary Client Configuration File](client-config.md)
* [Notary Server Configuration File](server-config.md)
* [Notary Signer Configuration File](signer-config.md)
* [Configuration sections common to the Notary Server and Signer](common-configs.md)
