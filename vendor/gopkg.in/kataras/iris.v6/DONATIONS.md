The main purpose of donations to open source is to say "thank you" to the developer rather than actually advancing the project.


Open source projects don’t need the money like those charities do—and so it’s usually phrased like: *Buy the developer a cup of coffee*.


<!--It's true that I am spending all my available time for Iris and its related projects, therefore I have no income value.

However, I am not asking from people to change the system. I know that the majority of us(devs) don't really care how authors of projects like Iris survive. I totally understand that.

If somebody out there can
help developers like me to worry less about daily life's dilemmas it would be easier for them to make the particular project(s) even better.
There are no limits to the Iris' potentials.


I am a realistic person. If things won't change for my daily life I will be forced to give Iris' managment to somebody else(that community could trust).-->

# Buy me a cup of coffee?

Iris is free and open source but developing it has taken thousands of hours of my time and a large part of my sanity. If you feel this web framework useful to you, it would go a great way to ensuring that I can afford to take the time to continue to develop it.

Thanks for your gratitude and finance help ♡
