## _future

This folder contains features that are marked as 'work-in-progress', they can take a long to be fully implemented and adopted to the Iris framework itself, even months.

Some people may find that bad idea, for many and different reasons, to upload them on that public repository so soon. 

But I think that it is a good place for new developers to view and track how a feature is being implemented step-by-step. How I develop Iris step-by-step. 

# Inspiration for new Iris Developers.

I have collected some tips for you!

- Do What They Think You Can't Do.
