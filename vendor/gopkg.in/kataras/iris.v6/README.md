<!--It's true that I am spending all my available time for Iris and its related projects, therefore I have no income value.

However, I am not asking from people to change the system. I know that the majority of us(devs) don't really care how authors of projects like Iris survive. I totally understand that.

If somebody out there can
help developers like me to worry less about daily life's dilemmas it would be easier for them to make the particular project(s) even better.
There are no limits to the Iris' potentials.


I am a realistic person. If things won't change for my daily life I will be forced to give Iris' managment to somebody else(that community could trust).-->

Buy me a cup of coffee?
------------

Iris is free and open source but developing it has taken thousands of hours of my time and a large part of my sanity. If you feel this web framework useful to you, it would go a great way to ensuring that I can afford to take the time to continue to develop it.


I spend all my time in the construction of Iris, therefore I have no income value.

Third Party Middleware
------------

Iris has its own middleware form of `func(ctx *iris.Context)` but it's also compatible with all `net/http` middleware forms using [iris.ToHandler](https://github.com/iris-contrib/middleware/blob/master/cors/cors.go#L33), i.e Negroni's middleware form of `func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request, next http.HandlerFunc)`.

FAQ

</p>

> Q: OK Iris is really fast, but my current website does not need that performance at the moment, are there other reasons to move into Iris?


Iris is fully vendored. That means it is independent of any API changes in the used libraries and **will work seamlessly in the future**!

The size of the executable file is a critical part of the Application Deployment Process.

Two very simple identical applications, the first was written with `iris` and the second with a simple golang router.

 - _iris_ had `8.505 KB` overall file size
 - _gin_ had `9.029 KB` overall file size
 - _net/http_ had produced an executable file with `5.380 KB` size.


> Iris has built'n support for the most of the features that you will use to craft your perfect web application, while the golang router(gin & httprouter alone) doesn't. Imagine what would happened if the simple app we created would use `sessions`, `websockets`, `view engine`... I tested that too, `gin` and `net/http` had produced the x3 of their original size, **while `iris application`' overall executable filesize remained stable**!


**Applications that are written using Iris produce smaller file size even if they use more features** than a simple router library!


Iris always follows the latest trends and best practices. Iris is the **Secret To Staying One Step Ahead of Your Competition**.


Iris is **a high-performance** tool, but it doesn't stops there. Performance depends on your application too, **Iris helps you to make the right choices** on every step.

**Familiar** and easy **API**. Sinatra-like REST API.

Contains examples and documentation for all its features.

Iris is a `low-level access` web framework, you always know what you're doing.

You'll **never miss a thing** from `net/http`, but if you do on some point, no problem because Iris is fully compatible with stdlib, you still have access to `http.ResponseWriter` and `http.Request`, you can adapt any third-party middleware of form `func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request, next http.HandlerFunc)` as well.

Iris is a community-driven project, **you suggest and I code**.

Unlike other repositories, this one is **very active**. When you post an issue, you get an answer at the next couple of minutes(hours at the worst). If you find a bug, **I am obliged to fix** that on the same day.

> Q: Why no `serverless`?

New web developers are so enthusiastic about the idea of `serverless` and `AWS`. Most of the experienced developers we already know that we shouldn't use these things for our critical parts of our application.


**`Serverless and AWS` Are Wonderful—Until They Go Wrong.**  There was a flash-point (at 28 February of 2017) where the 'internet was offline' and most of the sites, including isitdownrightnow.com,  were down or operated very slow! Why? Because of `serverless` and `AmazonS3`.
Please think twice before moving your code into `serverless`, **instead, use web frameworks that are created for servers that you control**, i.e Iris.

Proof of concept:

Philosophy
------------

The Iris philosophy is to provide robust tooling for HTTP, making it a great solution for single page applications, web sites, hybrids, or public HTTP APIs. Keep note that, today, iris is faster than nginx itself.

Iris does not force you to use any specific ORM or template engine. Iris is routerless which means you can adapt any router you like, [httprouter](https://github.com/kataras/iris/blob/v6/adaptors/httprouter/_example/main.go) is the fastest, [gorillamux](https://github.com/kataras/iris/blob/v6/adaptors/gorillamux/_example/main.go) has more features. With support for the most used template engines (5), you can quickly craft the perfect application.
