This repository follows the official [golang](https://github.com/golang/go#contributing) guidelines for the contributions:

##### Note that I do not accept pull requests here and that I use the issue tracker proposals only. Please ask questions on the  http://support.iris-go.com or [https://kataras.rocket.chat/channel/iris][chat].

Iris' features are not directly adopted to Iris. A component's feature/change should be tested for some time before being part of the Iris which users install.

Do PRs at the iris' components instead of the core.
You can find many repositories to help Iris with your contribution. The [iris-contrib](https://github.com/iris-contrib) is open for any
kind of PR, community is 100% responsible for the whole organisation.

 **Only one term to future authors**: A contributor should be responsible and answer to the future users' issues that are relative to her/his code. PR's authors must provide adequate support.
**Users is the most important part, we, as software authors, have to respect them. I don't accept any form of contempt to them(users) by anyone.**
